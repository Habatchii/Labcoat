# Labcoat
Labcoat for SuperWikia Alpha fabrication manages new or revised fabrication processes. Its 'Cleanroom' applets allow codesmiths to access the lab environment, used to create semiconductors, substrate prototypes, chipset instruction blocks and other Labcoat projects. Our extensions in future releases will include UML support for C#/C++ conforming projects, import/export architecture schematics and refactoring sub-projects.
The application's hosted cleanrooms are kernel level applets and can only be accessed by supervisors. The user defined cleanrooms are kept in the application's host computer and can be accessed by assigned users.

Each cleanroom may be certified for installation by completing a simple qualification diagnotic inspection. Once the applet has been mapped and appliances installed, a new U/I is created for user. Personalization of the console functions may be set to user preference using the dotCODES terminal.
